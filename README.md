# Fluid Simulation

## About:

- The main purpose for which I started this project is to learn the physics of fluid - and yes that's the Navier-Stokes equation! The Navier-Stoke equation is un-skippable for me since it relies on some of the simplest idea in classical mechanics, which is one of my all-time favorite topic.
- This project follows these sources:

- I actually copied their codes, then do some minor fixing and refactoring ~~(I've messed up with the code...)~~. And that's it! I present to you: The C# Windows Forms version of Fluid Simulation yay!!! :)
